## Getting Started

To get started with the SQL Library, follow these steps:

1. **Installation**: You can install the library via [package manager](#) or download it directly from our GitHub repository.

2. **Dependencies**: Make sure you have the required database driver installed for your specific database (e.g., mysql, sqlite, postgres, etc.).

3. **Include the Library**: Include the library in your project by importing it.

## Usage

Here's a basic example of how to use the SQL Library to execute a simple SQL query:

```python
from sql_library import SQLConnector

# Initialize a database connection
connection = SQLConnector('your_database_url', 'your_username', 'your_password')

# Execute a SELECT query
query = 'SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = ?'
username = 'example_user'
result = connection.execute(query, (username,))

# Process the query results
for row in result:
    print(row)

# Close the database connection when done
connection.close()
